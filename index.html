	<!--
	1) first the media directive convert every element with media-attr to a comment
	2) when a media query match the screen it will put the element back
	3) angularjs re-render that particular DOM
	4) angularjs sees a ng-include directive and download the template if it has not already done so
	5) angularjs append the template eiteher from memory or from a ajax call

<!--
	this particular example was made when byggmax wanted to display diffrent things on diffrent devices over at:
	http://www.byggmax.com/se-sv/byggvaror/altan-tradgard/impregnerat-virke

	so insted of loading all html data i figure "hey why not use the same json data, only diffrent is the template"
	css alone can't do all fancy stuff like turing a table into a neat lite user friendly table without displaying
	two/three tabels on all decice and toggle the display

	the json data can be found in app.js
